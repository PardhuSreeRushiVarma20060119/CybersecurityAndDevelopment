## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> **Important:**  
These are **standalone code examples**. There are **no backend or functional supporting services provided** for safety and ethical reasons.

- 🔒 These do **not** include vulnerable servers, tokens, or live endpoints.
- 🎓 These are **non-functional, simplified illustrations** meant to teach concepts.
- 🧪 If you're experimenting with live services, do so only on **private, safe test environments** you control.

## 🛠️ How to Use

- Open `.html` or `.js` files in a browser or code editor.
- Modify and extend locally using mock servers (e.g., Python Flask, Express.js).
- Ideal for:
  - Red teamers
  - AppSec learners
  - CTF challenge creators

## 🚀 Next Steps

✅ Add:
- Dockerized JWT/CORS demo APIs  
- GraphQL injection & NoSQL injection examples  
- Safe automation with Burp Suite or mitmproxy
