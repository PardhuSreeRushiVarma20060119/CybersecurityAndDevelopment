# Operationalizing CodeLlama with Open WebUI for Local LLM Inference Workflows

*“Not everything powerful needs the cloud, servers, infrastructure. Sometimes, the intelligence belongs at home.”*

---

## Introduction

In an age where AI development often feels locked behind GPU clusters and cloud paywalls, running powerful LLMs locally is no longer just a proof of concept — it’s a new standard for private, rapid, and personalized development.

One such game-changing combo is Meta’s CodeLlama (a powerful coding-oriented LLM) paired with Open WebUI, an elegant self-hosted web interface that brings local inference workflows to life.

In this blog, I walk you through how we turned CodeLlama into a local development companion, how it fits into everyday DevSecOps or R&D pipelines, and why this combination is more than just a test — it's a viable production-grade asset.

---

## Why CodeLlama?

Meta’s CodeLlama is a family of LLMs optimized specifically for code completion, debugging, generation, and reasoning. It’s capable, permissively licensed, and (with quantization and fine-tuning) surprisingly efficient for local environments.

### Key Features

- Specialized in Python, C++, Java, etc.
- Handles long context windows (up to 100K+ tokens)
- Available in 7B, 13B, and 34B parameter variants
- Easily finetunable with LoRA adapters

---

## Why Open WebUI?

Open WebUI acts as the local ChatGPT-style frontend for interacting with any LLM you run via Ollama.

- Beautiful, responsive UI for chatting with LLMs
- Local-first, privacy-respecting
- Integrates directly with Ollama, a CLI-based LLM runtime
- Supports context management, history, prompt templates

This makes it perfect for:

- Development workflows
- Coding assistant use
- Exploring model behavior without CLI fatigue

## Full Local Setup — No Cloud Needed

This setup was tested on a 16GB RAM laptop with Ollama and Docker installed.

### Step 1: Install & Run Ollama
For Windows, download from: https://ollama.com/download
![ollama](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad5ed529-6735-4d93-9cba-078d51ecf929)

### Step 2: Pull CodeLlama

```bash
ollama pull codellama:7b
```
To test:

```bash
ollama run codellama
```

### Step 3: Set Up Open WebUI

Run Open WebUI using Docker:

```bash
docker run -d   -p 3000:3000   --name open-webui   -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434   ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

![Docker Pull OpenWebUI](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcc36991-921c-4bfe-a464-ab977a803d96)
![Logs Of The Container](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/632365fb-2d84-4785-8f09-b9519141b599)
![Container Health](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fb334e6-5f2a-4a18-b783-2b4a8159a9ab)

Then open:  
http://localhost:3000

![OpenWebUI](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63ccd154-ea26-44a9-8dc5-0b8887978160)
You are now chatting with CodeLlama (LLM) through a local web interface.

## Dev Workflows with CodeLlama Locally

This setup turns CodeLlama into a personal AI code engineer. Use it for:

| Use Case                     | Example Prompt                                                |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Debugging                   | "Here’s my Python error, help me debug it."                  |
| Code Completion             | "Write a Python class for JWT auth middleware."              |
| DevSecOps Policy Suggestion | "Give me a Kubernetes network policy for a secure backend."  |
| Git Commit Generation       | "Write a commit message for this diff..."                    |
| Threat Simulation Snippets  | "Generate mock logs for a brute force SSH attack."           |

## Why It Matters for DevSecOps & AI R&D

- Privacy-First: No data leaves your device
- Cost-Effective: No GPU cloud bills
- Customizable: You can fine-tune your own CodeLlama variant
- Fast Iteration: No latency, no rate-limits, and complete control

## Performance Observations

| Metric                | 7B Model (Quantized)            |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
| RAM Used              | ~6.5 GB                         |
| Load Time             | ~15 seconds                     |
| Response Time         | 1–3 seconds per 50 tokens (CPU) |
| Temperature Support   | Yes                             |
| Context Window        | 4K–32K (variant dependent)       |

Running on CPU-only with 16GB RAM is viable for light to medium coding tasks.

generally for very smooth workflows, better go quantized or smaller models, or increasing your ram > 16GB.

## What Comes Next?

- Starting fine-tuning with OpenLoRa on domain-specific commits, logs, and workflows
- Observability with Prometheus and Grafana to monitor local inference behavior

## Final Thoughts

> *“You don’t need the cloud, heavy infrastructure, super specialized GPU's, servers etc, to build intelligence. Sometimes, the smartest dev in the room is the one running on your localhost.”*

CodeLlama + Open WebUI is more than just a local LLM test — it’s a window into the future of personal AI agents, private development copilots, and autonomous tooling for secure software workflows.
Try it. Build with it. Break it. Train it. Let your LLM Understand Your Dialect.
