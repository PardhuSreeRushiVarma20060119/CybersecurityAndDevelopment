## How Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) And AI Tooling Can Be Integrated Intelligently And Securely In SD Workflows?

1. AI/LLM Roles In Secure SDLC: 
    -
    - Secure Requirement Analysis Using AI Pattern Recognition (Known CVE's Etc.)
    - AI Assisted Threat Modeling (STRIDE, DREAD)
    - Integration Of LLMs into SAST & DAST Stages for Dynamic Analysis Prompts & False Positive Reduction.
    - Secure Design Documentation

2. Promt-Driven Development (Using Models like *"CodeLlama"* or *"Mistral"*) :
   -
   - Automate Development Of Backend Logic with OWASP Top 10 in mind.
   - RBAC Policy Generation, API Gateway Configurations, or Hardened Dockerfiles.
   - Infer Security Misconfigurations or Excessive Permissions for Code Reviews

3. CI/CD Workflow Integration :
   -
   - Embedding AI into CI/CD Workflows and tools like *"Github Actions"*, *"CircleCI"*, and *"GithubCI"*
   - Code Validation Aganist Predefined Secure Coding Standerds.
   - Automated Policy Enforcement (e.g., Deny Hardcoded Secrets, Flag Poor Cryptography Practices)
   - Automate Documentation Updates In CHANGELOGS With Secure Diffs From Commits using LLMs.
