# 🔐 Red Team Letters of Authorization (LoA) - Emergency Protocol Handbook

> **"Get Out of Jail Free" — Only if You're Smart Enough to Carry One.**

---

## 🧾 What is a Letter of Authorization?

A **Letter of Authorization (LoA)** is a formal legal document that distinguishes a **red team operator** from a **criminal intruder**. It explicitly states the **authorization and intent** behind a red team's actions and provides **credible proof of consent** from executive leadership for simulated attacks.

The **LoA is your lifeline** — if you’re confronted by law enforcement, site security, or internal staff, this document can be the difference between de-escalation and detainment.

> ✅ You **must** carry an LoA **100%** of the time during engagements.  
> 🚫 Authorization by email, word-of-mouth, or assumption is **not sufficient**.

---

## 📌 Use Cases

| Scenario | Likelihood of Using LoA |
|----------|--------------------------|
| **Capture the Flag** (Covert Ops) | 🔻 Low (~10%) |
| **Escalate Until Caught** (Detection Threshold Test) | 🔺 High (~80%) |

## 📋 Required Components of a Valid LoA

A professional LoA should **always** include:

- ✅ **Client Letterhead**
- ✅ **Professional Formatting** (no informal language)
- ✅ **Statement of Fact**:
  > _"The holder of this letter is authorized by [ClientName] to perform red team activities including physical and logical intrusion testing during the dates specified."_
- ✅ **Detainment Clause**:
  > _"The bearer should not be detained longer than necessary to verify the information presented within this letter."_
- ✅ **Red Teamer's Full Legal Name**
- ✅ **Dates of Validity** (Start and End Date)
- ✅ **Scope Locations** (Optional but recommended)
- ✅ **ID Verification Statement**:
  > _"The bearer shall carry government-issued photo identification matching the name on this letter."_
- ✅ **Compliance Statement** (Optional for restricted sites):
  > _"The bearer has completed all required training and certifications to operate on this site safely and compliantly."_
- ✅ **Emergency Contact Chain** (First, Second, Third Contact)

## 🛡️ Optional LoA Authentication Enhancements

### ✅ Option 1: Internal Verification Portals
Organizations may create internal Wikis, dashboards, or secure links that validate red teamer details when a **code or internal auth page** is provided.

> Example: `https://intranet.clientname.com/redteam-auth/XYZ123`

---

### 🔐 Option 2: Bilateral Authentication Phrases
- **On LoA**: A phrase such as `"Zulu-Foxtrot-Theta-99"`
- **To Client Security**: They receive a sealed envelope or secure file containing the same phrase.
- **Verification**: If security challenges the tester, they can confirm the code with the GSOC or director.

---

### 🕵️ Option 3: Phrase of the Day
For frequent red team testing environments:
- Daily/weekly **authentication phrases** are rotated.
- Shared during shift handoffs to security.

## 🚨 Authorization & Scope Caveats

Learn from incidents like the [2019 Coalfire Arrest](https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/05/coalfire_pentest_iowa_black_hat/). Red teamers were jailed due to **miscommunication of scope and jurisdiction.**

### ✅ Rules to Follow:
1. **Signer must have clear legal authority** over the space being tested.
2. **If law enforcement protects the facility**, they **must be informed** and listed as LoA contacts.
3. Verify if client is **tenant or owner**:
   - If **tenant**, ensure landlord agreements permit physical tests.
   - If **owner**, review internal security policy inclusion of landlord-controlled areas.

## 🧠 Operational Best Practices

### 1. 📱 LoA Contact Availability
Ensure all listed contacts are:
- On-call during your operation hours (even night shifts)
- Aware of test schedules
- In communication threads with red team leads

> **Tip**: Use Signal or Slack for pre- and post-engagement notices.

---

### 2. ✋ Safe Presentation Protocol
Do **NOT** reach for the LoA suddenly — treat the moment like a **police stop**:
- Calmly announce: _"I have a Letter of Authorization that explains my presence here."_
- Ask: _"May I reach into my jacket pocket to retrieve it?"_

## ⚠️ Legal Notice

> **Letters of Authorization are legally sensitive and operationally critical documents. Unauthorized use or forging of LoAs is a criminal offense. Ensure all documents are signed, current, and traceable.**

### 🧭 Author’s Note (From A Reddit User)

> These recommendations come from **over a decade of real-world red team experience**, including detainments involving helicopters, firearms, and law enforcement. Trust me: you’d rather have your LoA and not need it, than need it and not have it.

**Stay authorized. Stay alive. Stay sharp.**
