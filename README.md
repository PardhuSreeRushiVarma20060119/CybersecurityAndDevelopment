# Exploits Repository

## Description

Welcome to the **ExploitSpace-Repo** repository, a comprehensive collection of **vulnerability exploits**, **proof-of-concept (PoC) payloads**, **ctf's** and **reverse-engineering techniques**, **various practical concepts in various fields** tailored for my cybersecurity and cloud security needs. This repository documents a wide spectrum of **attack vectors** across different platforms, operating systems, cloud environments, and applications. From web-based exploits to kernel-level privilege escalation, this repository covers them all.

### Categories of Exploits Included:

- **Web Application Vulnerabilities**  
  - **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: Exploiting improper sanitization of user inputs in database queries.
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts into web pages to target users.
  - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Forcing users to execute unwanted actions.
  - **Command Injection**: Exploiting untrusted user inputs in system commands.
  - **XML External Entity (XXE)**: Attacking vulnerable XML parsers via external entity references.
  - **File Inclusion**: Remote/Local file inclusion vulnerabilities for executing arbitrary scripts.
  - **Open Redirects**: Redirecting users to malicious URLs by exploiting vulnerable web apps.
  - **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Triggering requests from the server to internal resources.

- **Privilege Escalation & Kernel Exploits** 
- **Network Protocol Exploits**
- **Mobile Platform Exploits** 
- **Cryptographic Exploits**  
- **Reverse Engineering**  
- **Post-Exploitation Techniques** 
- **Social Engineering Frameworks**
- **Red Teaming Techniques**
- **Cloud**

### **Why This Repository Exists**  
The goal of this repository is to provide **continuous learning** for professionals in the field, document evolving **exploitation techniques**, and create **proof-of-concept** scripts for educational and research purposes. All exploits are **demonstrated in a controlled environment** (e.g., CTFs or vulnerable machines), following ethical hacking practices.

We strive to create a repository that is both **educational** and **cutting-edge**, ensuring that each exploit is accompanied by a detailed explanation of the underlying vulnerability, the exploitation method, and mitigations or defenses.
